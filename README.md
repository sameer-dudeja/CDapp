Hi, This is a simple React App.
This app was made for an Assessment for a job in a Company.
It has the following features:

1. Navbar made with React-router and useRef.
2. A secondary Navbar which I like to call as Classbar.
3. It has a running Timer which stops when the End Class button is clicked
4. It opens a Modal which has a bunch of chechkboxes with a unique functionality.
5. The bottom buttons either stop/continue the timer.
6. It also has a Posts page which imports an External API as posts.
7. There is also an Error Page added in the Router
